## Introduction

We're almost at the end of the journey.
In our time together,
we've looked at tons of different programming concepts and techniques.
This is where you get to show it all off!

Your 3rd and final project
will be a **single-page Web application** using the **MERN stack**
(MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js)
that **you will work on in teams of three**.

You will also practice some **UX and Agile methodologies** by following
[the final project Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vnXgh1Y8/trello-template-final-project).

As usual, you and the Ironhack staff will vote for your favorites
and award three medals: Bronze ðŸ¥‰, Silver ðŸ¥ˆ, and Gold ðŸ¥‡.
**Medalists get to present in the Hackshow**, our public event for showcasing students.

Here are some examples of past projects:

- [Pairs in Paris](https://pairs-in-paris.herokuapp.com/)
- [Prism](https://customreactapp.herokuapp.com/)
- [Napply](https://napply.herokuapp.com/)
- [Recyclez-moi](https://recycleapp.herokuapp.com/)
- [Cool Coloc](https://cool-coloc.herokuapp.com/)

or the [Project #2 document](project2.md).

  [See Presentation Section](#presentations)

### Thursday - December 13th

- **16:00h** - _Presentation Practice #2_: Demo <br>
  For the second presentation practice
  you should incorporate a demo of your live app at the end of your talk.
  Your presentation structure should be more or less the same,
  but you should make adjustments based on feedback from the previous practice. <br>
  [See Demo Tips](#demo-tips)

## Updated Technical Requirements

You app must:

1. **Use React** for all of the user-facing parts of your application.
2. **Use Express** for your **API backend**
   that your React app will communicate with.
3. **Use Mongoose** for models and database communication.
4. **Have 3 models _or more_**.
   Having one for users is a no-brainer.
   The other two should represent the main functionality of your app.
   Don't force it if having a 3rd model doesn't make sense.
5. **Have validation on its models** with feedback for users
   if their submission is invalid.
6. **Include sign up, log in & log out functionality**
   with encrypted passwords (or social logins)
   and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
7. **Have _two_ repos on GitHub**.
   One for your React application and the other for your Express API backend.
8. Have at least **1 commit per day** that you worked on it.
9. **Be deployed online** using Heroku, so anybody could use your app.

Responsive design **is not a requirement**. <br>
Full CRUD **is not a requirement**.

## Updated Deliverables

- A **working MERN stack application, built by you** that runs on a server.
- A **deploy of your app** on Heroku.
- The **two URLs** of your **GitHub repositories** (React & Express).
- The URL of the **React app**.
- The URL of the **slides for your app's presentation**.
- Your **GitHub repos** should have
  the **URL of your live app** in the URL section.
- You must present your app during Project #3 final presentations
  (last day of Project #3 time).

Wireframes **are not a deliverable**. <br>
User stories **are not a deliverable**.

## Presentations

Project #3's presentation will focus more on you again, since you may be presenting to the public later.

### Format

- Talking with Slides: **3 minutes**
- Demo: **2 minutes**
- Total: **5 minutes**

### Attire

- Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations
  (last day of each project's time).
- Dress at least **one degree more elegantly** than you usually dress for class.
- _Examples_:
  - If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.
  - If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.
  - If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.

### Slide Applications

- All presentations will be done **from a staff member's computer**,
  so **your slides need to be online**.
- PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind **will not be accepted**.
- Suggested online slide applications:
  - [Slides](https://slides.com/)
  - [Prezi](https://prezi.com/)
  - [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)

### Presentation Structure

1. **Title Slide** (1 slide): your project's name & your name
2. **About Me** (1-2 slides):
   - Where are you from?
   - What are some interesting facts about you? (hobbies, travels, etc.)
3. **Project Elevator Pitch** (1-2 slides):
   - What is your project?
   - How does it work?
   - Why did you choose it?
4. **Technical Challenge** (1-2 slides):
   - What was **the most important** technical challenge you faced?
   - How did you overcome that challenge?
5. **Big Mistake** (1-2 slides):
   - What was **the biggest** mistake you made during this project?
   - What did you learn from it?
6. **Demo Slide** (1 slide): literally says "DEMO"
   with **a link** to your project so you can open it easily
7. **Closing Slide** (1 slide): your project's name, your name & a _"Thank You"_
8. **Total**: 7-11 slides

#### Presentation Structure Notes

- **Don't** include a slide just for the technologies.
- **Don't** include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
- **Don't** include a slide for GitHub graphs.
- **Don't** go into detail about how the app works.
  Your demo is where you want to do that.
- If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation,
  feel free to do so.
  This suggested structure is mostly for people who don't know what to do.

### Demo Tips

1. Plan what you are going to demo and **practice it on the live site**.
   That way you won't be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2. **Deploy early** so you can squash bugs.
   There are _always_ bugs on the live site at first.
3. Add **link to your live project** to your DEMO slide
   so you can start it smoothly.
4. Your app's colors and sizing **might look different on the projector**.
   If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.
5. If you app is on Heroku, **refresh it before you present**.
   Otherwise there will be a delay on the initial load.
