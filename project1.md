Introduction
------------
Let's start with something fun for your first project - **a game!**

It's important to make your game exciting and _juicy_!
For more information about making your game _juicy_,
[see the lesson about it on the platform](http://learn.ironhack.com/#/learning_unit/4317).

You and the Ironhack staff will also vote for your favorites
and award three medals: Bronze ðŸ¥‰, Silver ðŸ¥ˆ, and Gold ðŸ¥‡.

2. **Have logic for winning and/or losing**
   and show feedback to the player in either case.
3. Include **separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript**.
4. Use **plain JavaScript or jQuery** for DOM manipulation
   (or HTML canvas for graphics).
5. **Have a repo on GitHub**.
6. Have at least **1 commit per day** that you worked on it.
7. **Be deployed online** using GitHub Pages, so anybody can play it.


Updated Deliverables
--------------------
- A **working game, built by you** that runs in the browser.
- A **deploy of your game** in GitHub Pages.
- The URL of the **GitHub repository** for your game.
- The URL of the **live game on the Internet**.
- The URL of the **slides for your game's presentation**.
- You must present your game during Project #1 final presentations
  (last day of Project #1 time).


Presentations
-------------
For each of the 3 projects you make at Ironhack,
you will also have to make a presentation about it.
Communication (including public speaking) is an important skill to practice
for finding a job after Ironhack.

### Format ###
- Talking with Slides: **3 minutes**
- Demo: **2 minutes**
- Total: **5 minutes**

### Attire ###
- Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations
  (last day of each project's time).
- Dress at least **one degree more elegantly** than you usually dress for class.
- _Examples_:
  * If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.
  * If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.
  * If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.

### Slide Applications ###
- All presentations will be done **from a staff member's computer**,
  so **your slides need to be online**.
- PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind **will not be accepted**.
- Suggested online slide applications:
  * [Slides](https://slides.com/)
  * [Prezi](https://prezi.com/)
  * [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)

### Presentation Structure ###
1. **Title Slide** (1 slide): your project's name & your name
2. **About Me** (1-2 slides):
    * Where are you from?
    * What are some interesting facts about you? (hobbies, travels, etc.)
3. **Project Elevator Pitch** (1-2 slides):
    * What is your project?
    * How does it work?
    * Why did you choose it?
4. **Technical Challenge** (1-2 slides):
    * What was **the most important** technical challenge you faced?
    * How did you overcome that challenge?
5. **Big Mistake** (1-2 slides):
    * What was **the biggest** mistake you made during this project?
    * What did you learn from it?
6. **Demo Slide** (1 slide): literally says "DEMO"
   with **a link** to your project so you can open it easily
7. **Closing Slide** (1 slide): your project's name, your name & a _"Thank You"_
8. **Total**: 7-11 slides

#### Presentation Structure Notes ####
- **Don't** include a slide just for the technologies.
- **Don't** include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
- **Don't** include a slide for GitHub graphs.
- **Don't** go into detail about how the app works.
  Your demo is where you want to do that.
- If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation,
  feel free to do so.
  This suggested structure is mostly for people who don't know what to do.

### Demo Tips ###
1. Plan what you are going to demo and **practice it on the live site**.
   That way you won't be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2. **Deploy early** so you can squash bugs.
   There are _always_ bugs on the live site at first.
3. Add **link to your live project** to your DEMO slide
   so you can start it smoothly.
4. Your app's colors and sizing **might look different on the projector**.
   If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.
5. If your app is on Heroku, **refresh it before you present**.
   Otherwise there will be a delay on the initial load.
